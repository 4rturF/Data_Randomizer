# Data_Randomizer
UPDATE: 26.06.2021 Data Randomizer 

HI!
The whole purpose of the Data ranomizer app you can check here: https://github.com/users/4rturF/projects/1

My main goal here is also to make an app for newbies like me to practice data analysis skills. At the moment the project might seem poor, but I'm gonna change in the nearest future.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Constatnly changing class names at carrefour.pl
- Issue with scraping one page of products
